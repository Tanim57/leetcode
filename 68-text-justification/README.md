<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/">68. Text Justification</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><div><p>Given an array of strings <code>words</code> and a width <code>maxWidth</code>, format the text such that each line has exactly <code>maxWidth</code> characters and is fully (left and right) justified.</p>

<p>You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces <code>' '</code> when necessary so that each line has exactly <code>maxWidth</code> characters.</p>

<p>Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.</p>

<p>For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between words.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.</li>
	<li>Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.</li>
	<li>The input array <code>words</code> contains at least one word.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<div class="top-box hide"><div class="alert-info"></div></div><pre data-original-code="Input: words = [&quot;This&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;justification.&quot;], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   &quot;This    is    an&quot;,
   &quot;example  of text&quot;,
   &quot;justification.  &quot;
]" data-snippet-id="ext.f0a224fae73f21a42051567e4175b070" data-snippet-saved="false" data-codota-status="done"><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
<strong>Output:</strong>
[
&nbsp; &nbsp;"This &nbsp; &nbsp;is &nbsp; &nbsp;an",
&nbsp; &nbsp;"example &nbsp;of text",
&nbsp; &nbsp;"justification. &nbsp;"
]</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<div class="top-box hide"><div class="alert-info"></div></div><pre data-original-code="Input: words = [&quot;What&quot;,&quot;must&quot;,&quot;be&quot;,&quot;acknowledgment&quot;,&quot;shall&quot;,&quot;be&quot;], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  &quot;What   must   be&quot;,
  &quot;acknowledgment  &quot;,
  &quot;shall be        &quot;
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is &quot;shall be    &quot; instead of &quot;shall     be&quot;, because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word." data-snippet-id="ext.ab1287c8343884e94541464007ec98c0" data-snippet-saved="false" data-codota-status="done"><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
<strong>Output:</strong>
[
&nbsp; "What &nbsp; must &nbsp; be",
&nbsp; "acknowledgment &nbsp;",
&nbsp; "shall be &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"
]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.</pre>
